# Gilded Rose PHP kata starter

This is a simple php kata starter:
- Source code lives in `src/`  
- Test code lives in `tests/`

## Requirements:

- docker-compose

## How to use it:

- `make init` to setup the project
- `make test` to run your tests
- `make test-with-coverage` to run your tests and generate code coverage

Coverage lives in `coverage/` (open `coverage/index.html` in your browser to see it)
